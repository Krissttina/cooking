# cooking
Angular Project

Condition:
The application should have:
• public part (accessible without authentication) 
• private part (available for registered users)
-A website in with cooking recepies can be created, uploaded, read, deleted or edited(CRUD)
The application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques: 
• At least 3 different dynamic pages (pages like about, contacts, login, register do not count towards that figure). If your project doesn’t cover this condition you will not be graded. 
• Use Angular for the client-side 
• Communicate to a remote service (via REST, sockets, GraphQL, or a similar client-server technique).
• Implement authentication 
Apply error handling and data validation to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered 
• Brief documentation on the project and project architecture (as .md file) 
• Good usability. Good UI and UX. (NGBootstrap, MDL, CSS Grids or another method of your choice)

Bonus:
• Deploy the application in a cloud environment 
• Use a file storage cloud API, e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive or other for storing the files. 
• Use of features of HTML 5 like Geolocation, SVG, Canvas, etc. 
• Use Angular Animations somewhere in your application 
• Write unit tests for your components 
• Use RxJS powered state management for Angular applications, inspired by Redux (ngRx store) 
• Anything that is not described in the assignment is a bonus if it has some practical use.
